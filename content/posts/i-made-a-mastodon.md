I watched _The Social Dilemna_ on Netflix last week and got properly spooked. The documentary itself was fine (the dramatic re-enactments were a bit schmaltzy), but it reminded me of _Adam Ruins Everything_, NYT's _Rabbit Hole_ and about a billion articles that I've read on social media.

So I decided to make a Mastodon.

To start, I haven't been on Facebook for about 6 years, and besides Twitter I've largely ignored social media. Most of my online communication has been either Twitter DMs, Discord, or Google Hangouts. I'm not really leaving them either, just trying out an additional one. I'm hoping that some of the slower conversations that happen in my social media right now move over here, and maybe some fun bots pop up over time.

We'll see how it goes.
