<h1>Streaming!</h1>

<p>I tried developing my blog live on stream over the weekend and it went better than expected! My big motivation for streaming was to keep myself focused while I worked. Twitch ended up being a great excuse to stay on task and verbalize my intent before writing code.</p>

<p>I streamed for a little over two hours, at one point picking up 7 concurrent viewers (whoo!). Before I went live, I sent a message to some friends on Discord, and about half of them showed up (thanks!). Surprisingly, some people that I didn't know showed up and chatted! I didn't really expect that Twitch would make my stream discoverable in any way, but apparently it did.</p>

<p>I spent most of the stream fiddling with CSS and HTML layouts for this blog. We had a few nice conversations that stayed mostly on-topic, and the whole experience felt much more cohesive than I would have predicted.</p>

<p>Before I started streaming I spent half an hour recording myself using this set up. This let me preview all of the technical details like video quality and window layout, but it also let me focus on coding for about 30 minutes. If I were to do it again, I would probably do more prep, maybe outline the feature I want to implement before starting the stream.</p>

<p>Overall, I had a surprisingly good experience on Twitch. I got to work on a side project in a casual, fun format. I'm going to try to make it a Saturday habit, so check it out over at <a href="https://twitch.tv/stambrawl">twitch.tv/stambrawl!</a></p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>I used Microsoft PowerToys to save the configuration of all of my windows before jumping into the stream. This came in very handy when I was fumbling between browser and VSCode, because PowerToys let me snap everything back to its original position.</p>

<p>The left side of the screen had two small windows hidden behind a text banner. I used these to control OBS and watch Twitch Chat during the stream.</p>

<h2>Gear</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Raspberry Pi Webcam (effectively the Pi Camera v2)</li>
    <li>Blue Snowball USB microphone</li>
    <li>gaming PC with Intel i9-9900K and NVIDIA RTX 2070</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, nothing fancy besides the gaming PC. I'm sure that my lighting and audio could have been better, but what I had worked really well as a proof of concept.</p>
